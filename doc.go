// Package scany is a set of packages for scanning data from a database into Go structs and more.
/*
scany isn't limited to any specific database. It integrates with database/sql,
so any database with database/sql driver is supported.
It also works with https://github.com/jackc/pgx - specific library for PostgreSQL.
Apart from the out of the box support, scany can be easily extended to work with almost any database library.

scany contains the following packages:

sqlscan package works with database/sql standard library.

pgxscan package works with github.com/jackc/pgx library.

dbscan package works with an abstract database and can be integrated with any library that has a concept of rows.
This particular package implements core scany features and contains all the logic.
Both sqlscan and pgxscan use dbscan internally.
